# Git From Scratch

codecrafters without codecrafters >.<

## Goals

1. Finish all of the stages
2. Write my own testing harnesses for both the internal code and the CLI
3. Use Nom to replace my own parser
4. Learn some new things about Git, namely worktrees and object layout

## Non Goals

1. Performance is a consideration but not a priority
2. Following the stages word for word is not something I care about
